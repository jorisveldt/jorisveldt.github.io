Initially I wanted to create a WordPress website but I came across this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1253968323781550080&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Although Jon Yongfook migrated his website to Middleman, suggesting that it might be a better solution. I figured out that it was what he was looking for and that Jekyll is what I’m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Althoug I followed a 10 week bootcamp in fullstack webdevelopment in 2018, setting up this blog was an experience. I must say the documentation was pretty easy to follow. But then the challenging part came. I wanted to have a nice layout but didn’t know exactly what. So I was just fiddling around and never satisfied with the result. Simply because I didn’t knew how I wanted to have it look like. This is the first lesson I learned with setting up this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I saw that it is possible to use Git and Github Pages with Jekyll. I know that a lot of companies work with Git and that it would be nice to gain some experience with it. Git is a version control system that keeps track of all your changes. When I’m done with changing I commit a change and push it to Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies have a Development, Test, Acceptance and Production (DTAP) Environment. In my case, my Macbook is my Development area and Github Pages is my production environment. I code and test on my computer and when I’m satisfied I push the changes to Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my third or fourth time pushing I didn’t see any changes while I supposed to see a lot of changes because I added a lot of CSS. I figured out that the reason why I didn’t see any changes was because Chrome saved everything in Cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the blog design of &lt;a href=&quot;https://levels.io&quot;&gt;Pieter Levels&lt;/a&gt; and copied a lot of his CSS. So all credits go to him! I made some adjustments because I would like to have my blog displayed as an archive. Honestly, I don’t think there is anything wrong with copying code and using it for your own website. As long as it suids your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep improving the layout of my blog over time and this blog will be my place to share my progress. I set the goal to learn more about programming and I will create a planning and try to stick to that. A nice addition is that I can increase my writing skills and I want to apoligize beforehand for all grammar mistakes. Hopefully it will get better on the run.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joris Veldt</name></author><category term="fruit" /><category term="summer" /><summary type="html">Today I created this blog with Jekyll.
