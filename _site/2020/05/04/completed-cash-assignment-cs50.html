<p>This assignment was about returning change with as less as possible coins. In this particular exercise I only had coins of 25, 10, 5 and 1 cents. So if I’d get 41 cents in change I would get 4 coins.</p>

<p>For simplicity I was allowed to prompt to the user the amount of change I owed him. This means that the user could fill in how much change he/she needed to receive. The user was allowed to fill in a float number. If he’d paid with a $10 dollar bill and bought a bread of 25 cents he would get $9.75 in change.</p>

<p>I needed to convert this number to cents and used the following solution for that:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">userChange</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now I always had a round number that I could use for further problem solving. At this point, I needed to initialize a new variable (coins) because I need to say to my customer how many many coins he/she would get.</p>

<p>Then, I wanted to start a loop to iterate over my conditional logic. I used a while loop <code>while (cents &gt; 0)</code>. My conditional logic was as follows, if the cents were bigger than or equal to 25 then I wanted to divide the cents by 25 and assign the result to the variable coins. I used the operate <code>+=</code> because my code would break if there would be a 50 cent coin added later on to my code. It would ‘forget’ the number of coins of 50 cents.</p>

<p>Finally, I needed to know the total cents left for further evaluation. I solved this problems by using the modulus operator. For example, <code>41 % 25</code> gives 16. This number could be used for further conditional logic.</p>

<p>Here is my solution:</p>
