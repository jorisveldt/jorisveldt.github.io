I"<p>The last couple of days I proceeded with the CS50 course. I watched the course material for week 2 and 3 and finished the “easier” assignments. On the one hand, I feel guilty for not finishing the “more difficult” assignments, but on the other hand, I like to move forward and I still have the possibility to finish them later. Honestly, we all know that finishing later means not doing it at all (in most cases). But let’s focus on the better part: I made a lot of progress last days so let’s elaborate on that!</p>
