I"B<p>Today I created this blog with Jekyll. Initially I wanted to create a WordPress website but I came across this tweet. Although Jon Yongfook migrated his website to Middleman, suggesting that it might be a better solution. I figured out that it was what he was looking for and that Jekyll is what Iâ€™m looking for.</p>
