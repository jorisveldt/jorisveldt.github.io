I"ñ<p>Today I created this blog with Jekyll. Initially I wanted to create a WordPress website but I came across this tweet. Although Jon Yongfook migrated his website to Middleman, suggesting that it might be a better solution. I figured out that it was what he was looking for and that Jekyll is what Iâ€™m looking for.</p>

<p>In the past I followed a 10 week bootcamp in fullstack webdevelopment. I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.JS and PostgreSQL. This is almost two years ago and I want to start programming again. So I am seeing myself as a beginner and I must admit that I have the tendency to start over with new courses all the time. In this way I never go next level and seem to be caught in an infinite loopâ€¦</p>

<p>This blog will be my place to share my progress. I will create a planning and try to stick to that. A nice addition is that I can increase my writing skills and I want to apoligize beforehand for all grammar mistakes. Hopefully it will get better on the run.</p>
