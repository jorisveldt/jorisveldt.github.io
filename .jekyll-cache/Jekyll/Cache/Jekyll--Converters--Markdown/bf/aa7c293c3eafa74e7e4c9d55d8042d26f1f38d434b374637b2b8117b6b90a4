I"F<p>A few year back a friend recommended to watch the documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/nl-en/title/80114460">minimalism</a>. Like every good friend does, I watched the documentary and I was mindblown. The two makers of the documentary pledged for a life with having less stuff and debt and being happy as f*ck.</p>
