A few year back a friend recommended to watch the documentary [minimalism](https://www.netflix.com/nl-en/title/80114460). Like every good friend does, I watched the documentary and I was mindblown. The two makers of the documentary pledged for a life with having less stuff and debt and being happy as f\*ck.

It made so much sense to me what these guys were saying. We are continously manipulated by ads, ads and more ads to buy stuff that we actually don't need. I must admit that I had the same feeling when I bought clothes. It shortly gave me a 'happy' feeling (for a few hours or so) and after wearing it a couple of times it dropped further down on the pile of all my other clothes. And I have a lot of clothes...

After this documentary I decided to change my buying behaviour. I took the decision to wear down all my clothes rather than throwing it away. Furthermore, I would think and (over)think whether or not I should buy something. Asking the question to myself *do I really need it?*

I'm not saying that I don't buy stuff anymore because I do. In some cases I really need something because I don't have it. For example, I got a job that required me to dress myself in business clothes. So I bought a couple of nice shirts. So don't push yourself too hard.

This point is just clothes. What do you think about expensive cars? A cheap car does the same thing as an expensive car. How about carpets? Vases? You can continue with the list. Especially the financial part is interesting. Why do we want to buy an expensive house with a mortgage that is way too high?

I'm not saying that we should not buy a house because it is a good investment. When you rent a house you also burn your money, but you're not 'sticked' to one place. It doesn't matter which side you choose. As long as you're comfortable with it.

What's the point? Think for yourself and don't copy the behaviour of others without a reason.

PS: I'm sorry if this story was confusing or not clear. I have noticed that it is damn difficult to express your thoughts on a blog. I guess it will improve over time.
