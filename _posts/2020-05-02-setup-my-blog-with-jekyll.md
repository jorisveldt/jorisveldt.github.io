Today I created this blog with Jekyll. Initially I wanted to create a WordPress website but I came across this tweet. Although Jon Yongfook migrated his website to Middleman, suggesting that it might be a better solution. I figured out that it was what he was looking for and that Jekyll is what I'm looking for.

Althoug I followed a 10 week bootcamp in fullstack webdevelopment in 2018, setting up this blog was an experience. I must say the documentation was pretty easy to follow. But then the challenging part came. I wanted to have a nice layout but didn't know exactly what. So I was just fiddling around and never satisfied with the result. Simply because I didn't knew how I wanted to have it look like. This is the first lesson I learned with setting up this blog.

In addition, I saw that it is possible to use Git and Github Pages with Jekyll. I know that a lot of companies work with Git and that it would be nice to gain some experience with it. Git is a version control system that keeps track of all your changes. When I'm done with changing I commit a change and push it to Github Pages.

A lot of companies have a Development, Test, Acceptance and Production (DTAP) Environment. In my case, my Macbook is my Development area and Github Pages is my production environment. I code and test on my computer and when I'm satisfied I push the changes to Github.

After my third or fourth time pushing I didn't see any changes while I supposed to see a lot of changes because I added a lot of CSS. I figured out that the reason why I didn't see any changes was because Chrome saved everything in Cache.

I will keep improving the layout of my blog over time and this blog will be my place to share my progress. I set the goal to learn more about programming and I will create a planning and try to stick to that. A nice addition is that I can increase my writing skills and I want to apoligize beforehand for all grammar mistakes. Hopefully it will get better on the run.
